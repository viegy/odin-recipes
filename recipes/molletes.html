        <p>A mollete is a traditional meal from Mexico and it consists of a bolillo cut by half
            and with different ingredients on top of it.</p>
        <p>For this recipe, we will use beans, chorizo and some cheese.</p>
        <p>You can combine this with your favorite sauce, eggs and a mix of tomatoes, onions and coriander
            as it is shown in the picture.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients (3 people):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Bolillos</li>
            <li>1/4 kg of boiled beans</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>200 g of mexican chorizo</li>
            <li>1 spoon of butter</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 handful of oregano</li>
            <li>150 g of cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To start, cut the onion in very little cubes with a knife. You can also blender the onion, but cut it in various pieces first.</li>
            <li>Add a spoon of butter to a pan and wait for it to melt. Once it is liquid, add the onion and the oregano. Then, start mixing until the onion becomes semi-transparent. This will smell very good.</li>
            <li>Now it's time to add the beans. Start mixing the ingredients and when they get hot enough, grind them with a masher until the texture gets ready to be spreadable on the mollete.</li>
            <li>Cut the bolillos by the half so you result with 4 parts. Hot them up in the fire. Spread the beans on the top of each with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Add the desired quantity of chorizo and cheese too.</li>
            <li>You can finish the dish by placing eggs, sauces, bacon or whatever you like to make the meal even better! </li>
        </ol>
