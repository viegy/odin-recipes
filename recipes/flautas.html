    <p>Flautas are a great food. They are delicious and have all the mexican flavor inside of them.
        Maybe they are a little bit messy to cook, but the results are definitely worth the job.</p>
    
    <p>The crunchyness of the tortilla along with the softness of the filling of chicken meat make
        a great combination.</p>

    <p>We recommend you to prepare your favorite sauce so you can shower the flautas and enjoy the
        experience as if you were eating in Mexico City itself.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients (2 people)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup of cooking oil</li>

        <li>2 cups of crumbled cheese </li>
        <li>10 tortillas</li>
        <li>Previously prepared pico de gallo</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the tortillas for 1 minute or until they are slightly soft (you can use the microwave or a griddle).</li>
        <li>Fill each tortilla with approximately 3-4 tablespoons of the chicken mixture. Roll up each tortilla and secure with a toothpick. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes. Fry 5 flautas at a time until golden brown, approximately 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the flutes to a napkin using a pair of tongs. Remove chopsticks before serving. Serve each serving with approximately 2 tablespoons of sour cream, 3 tablespoons of queso Fresco, and 3 tablespoons of pico de gallo. Enjoy!</li>
